        <h2>üöÄ Why C++ Still Dominates Competitive Programming</h2>
        <p>
          If you‚Äôve ever participated in coding contests, you already know C++ is the undisputed king.  
          Its speed, memory control, and the <b>Standard Template Library (STL)</b> make it the ultimate choice 
          for competitive programmers. But what exactly gives it this edge over other modern languages?

        <p>
          In this blog, we explore the power of STL, compare C++ to Python and Java, and provide a roadmap 
          to master C++ for contests like <b>Codeforces</b>, <b>LeetCode</b>, and <b>ICPC</b>.
